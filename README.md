## Candidate test - fullstack - David Marom

- Live Demo: [https://xr-chi.vercel.app/](https://xr-chi.vercel.app/)
- Git: [https://github.com/DavidMarom/xr](https://github.com/DavidMarom/xr)

### Local Deployment:
This is a Next.js project so client and server are both here
MongoDB is on Atlas so no need to install anything

`next.config.js` and `next-env.d.ts` are not included in the repo (contains mongoDB connection string). I will send them to you by email.

```
git clone https://github.com/DavidMarom/xr.git
npm i
npm run dev
```
